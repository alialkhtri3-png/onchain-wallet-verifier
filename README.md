Onchain Wallet Verifier

Open infrastructure to verify wallet ownership and basic onchain reputation — without KYC.

## What it does
Onchain Wallet Verifier confirms that a user controls a wallet and returns a simple reputation signal based on onchain activity.

## Why it matters
Web3 needs trust without identity leakage.  
This tool helps:

## How it works

2. Signature is verified
3. Onchain data is analyzed
4. A verification result and score are returned

## Supported Networks
